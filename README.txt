  HOW TO PLAY:
  ============

  Start  Hexxagon by tapping  on the  application  icon in the application 
  launcher.  After  a  short while,  you will be presented  with the  main 
  Hexxagon  screen in which you may  select the type  of game  you wish to 
  play, or setup any configuration options.

  Hexxagon is a variation of the popular board game Othello, where the aim
  of the game is to fill the board with as many  pieces that belong to you
  as possible.  The board is  hexagonal in size,  with  each piece on  the 
  board having up to six neighboring pieces. Moving a piece over one space 
  (to neighbor) creates  a new piece (a duplicate),  while moving over two 
  spaces physically moves the piece.

  Move  the cursor above the piece that you wish to move.  With the stylus 
  it will automatically be  selected when lifted, press the  select button 
  if using the keys. The valid moves are then shown. Tap one, and the move
  will  occur!  You  may  configure  the  key  and  sound  volume  in  the 
  configuration  screen.  You get  to this  by  selecting  the  menu  item  
  'Config'  in  the  'Game' menu.  Consult your handheld device manual for 
  instructions of  selecting a menu item.  When a game is active,  you may 
  tap the speaker icon at the bottom left  of  the screen  to get  to  the  
  configuration  screen.  It  is  possible to  pause  the current  game in 
  progress by tapping the paw icon.

  REGISTRATION:
  =============
 
  Hexxagon is shareware, the demonstration version brings up a dialog with
  "please register" at the start and end of each game (annoying, we know).
  The game is fully playable with the default board layouts and  positions
  In the registered version, ten different board layouts are available and
  other  positioning systems  including the  unpredictable "random" mode - 
  which  makes  the  game  very fun.  To  access these  features a  device  
  identification  number  is  required  to  generate  a  unique  unlocking 
  registration datafile.

  You can get to the registration screen by  selecting the 'Register' menu 
  item in the 'Game' menu.  It is very  important to ensure  that you copy 
  down the device identification exactly as it is presented in this dialog
  as follows:

   45:6D:75:6C:61:74:6F:72:39 <--- generated from the "Emulator" username

  It is  very common that users copy down this information incorrectly and
  hence delay the registration process. An exact match is required for the
  restration process to succeed.

  REGISTRATION IS $5 and can be made at PalmGearHQ and are not refundable.
  Once  your purchase is  made,  you will receive a serial number that you 
  will then need to  enter when  you fill in  survey at the  following web
